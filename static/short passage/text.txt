Emma stepped outside and found a small box on her doorstep (Surprise, emphasis: small)
She stared at it trying to remember if she had ordered anything (Neutral, emphasis: remember)
A folded note inside had nothing written (Neutral, emphasis: nothing)
She lifted the lid and gasped as a silver bracelet shimmered in the light (Surprise, emphasis: bracelet)
It looked exactly like the one her grandmother used to wear (Sad, emphasis: wear)
She traced the patterns on it remembering how she had lost it long ago (Sad, emphasis: lost)
She looked around wondering who could have left it there and why (Angry, emphasis: left)
Her heart pounded as frustration bubbled inside her chest (Angry, emphasis: pounded)
Then warmth filled her as she held the bracelet tightly and smiled (Happy, emphasis: smiled)
She placed it on her wrist feeling as if her grandmother was near once more (Happy, emphasis: near)
